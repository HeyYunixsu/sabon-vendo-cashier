# Installing on a New Raspberry Pi

Copy-paste runbook for provisioning a fresh Pi from a blank OS image to a
running machine. Every command is meant to be pasted as-is except where a
`<placeholder>` appears.

Read section 0 before pasting anything — two of the steps need a reboot, and
doing them in the wrong order costs you a full rebuild.

**Order matters:**

```
0. Prep          -> 1. Boot config (REBOOT)  -> 2. Get the code
3. config.env    -> 4. Dependencies          -> 5. Build & launch
6. Verify        -> 7. Calibrate sensors
```

## 0. Before you start

### Use a wired connection if you can

You are about to pull ~100 MB of packages, build WiringPi from source, and run
an npm install. On marginal WiFi these fail halfway and leave apt in a
part-finished state. Ethernet avoids an entire class of problem.

Check the link quality if you must use WiFi:

```bash
iwgetid
cat /proc/net/wireless      # link quality under ~40/70 is trouble
```

### Work inside tmux

If SSH drops mid-install, tmux keeps the install running.

```bash
sudo apt install -y tmux
tmux new -s setup
```

Reattach after a dropped connection with `tmux attach -t setup`.

### Wait out the background updater

Raspberry Pi OS runs `packagekitd` after boot and it holds the apt lock. If you
see `Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock`, that is what has it.

```bash
while sudo fuser /var/lib/apt/lists/lock >/dev/null 2>&1; do
  echo "apt still locked, waiting..."; sleep 10
done; echo "lock free"
```

### Force apt to IPv4

Pi IPv6 is often half-configured, and apt burns minutes timing out on it.

```bash
echo 'Acquire::ForceIPv4 "true";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99force-ipv4
sudo apt update
```

## 1. Boot configuration — GPIO pull-ups and safe pump states

**Do this first. It needs a reboot, and skipping it causes phantom button
presses and pumps that run dry during boot.**

Two separate problems this solves.

**Buttons** are wired GPIO to GND (active-low), so each input needs a pull-up to
have a defined level when the button is not pressed. WiringPi's pull control is
unreliable on current Debian, so it is set at firmware level instead.

**Pump relays are active-low** — a LOW input switches the pump ON. On the Pi,
GPIO 9–27 power up with a pull-DOWN, which means five of the six pump relays sit
**energized from power-on until the controller starts**. That is 30+ seconds of
a pump running dry on every boot. Driving them HIGH at firmware init fixes it.

```bash
sudo tee -a /boot/firmware/config.txt >/dev/null <<'EOF'

# --- Sabon dispenser ---
# Buttons: wired to GND, need pull-ups (wiringPi's pull control is unreliable)
gpio=10,13,14,23,24,25=ip,pu
# Pump relays are active-low: drive HIGH at boot so they are OFF before the
# controller starts, otherwise they energize during boot and run pumps dry
gpio=6,12,15,16,17,18=op,dh
EOF

sudo reboot
```

Verify after the reboot:

```bash
raspi-gpio get 10,13,14,23,24,25    # each: func=INPUT pull=UP
raspi-gpio get 6,12,15,16,17,18     # each: func=OUTPUT level=1
```

> **Water sensor pins are deliberately absent from this list.** They are pulled
> up in Python instead. `RPi.GPIO` defaults to `PUD_OFF` and *actively writes*
> it, so `GPIO.setup()` would undo a boot-time pull seconds after startup.
> `water_level_monitoring.py` sets `PUD_UP` itself.

### If SPI is enabled, turn it off

GPIO 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 are the SPI0 pins, and this project uses all five
(LED6, water 5, water 6, BTN4, water 4). If SPI is on, the peripheral claims
them and those channels die.

```bash
grep -nE "^dtparam=spi" /boot/firmware/config.txt
```

Comment out any `dtparam=spi=on` you find, then reboot. Nothing here uses SPI.

---

## 2. Get the code

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/HeyYunixsu/sabon-vendo-cashier.git
cd sabon-vendo-cashier
git checkout feat/enable-six-products
git log --oneline -1
```

> **The six-slot work lives on `feat/enable-six-products`, not `master`.**
> `master` is still the five-slot version with the broken dashboard
> registration. Until the branch is merged, checking out `master` on this Pi
> silently reverts you. Confirm the branch before continuing.

---

## 3. Create `config.env`

`CONFIG/config.env` is **gitignored** — it will not arrive with the clone, and
it is the one file you must create by hand on every machine.

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/sabon-vendo-cashier
cp CONFIG/config.env.sample CONFIG/config.env
nano CONFIG/config.env
```

Three values are machine-specific and must be set:

| Key | What to put |
|-----|-------------|
| `vendorId` | The vendor UUID from the cloud dashboard |
| `machineId` | This machine's number — **unique per Pi** |
| `TRANSACTION_DIR` | Absolute path: `/home/<user>/Desktop/sabon-vendo-cashier/transaction` |

`TRANSACTION_DIR` must be absolute and must match this clone's real location.
If the username is not `dgsi`, change it. Get the correct value with:

```bash
echo "TRANSACTION_DIR=$HOME/Desktop/sabon-vendo-cashier/transaction"
```

Everything else in the sample has a working default. See
[CONFIG/README.md](../CONFIG/README.md) for every key.

If you are replacing a machine, copy `calibrateProduct1`–`calibrateProduct6`
from the old Pi — those are physically measured per-pump flow rates and cannot
be guessed.

---

## 4. Install system dependencies

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/sabon-vendo-cashier
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh setup_and_run.sh
./install_dependencies.sh 2>&1 | tee install_dependencies.log
```

Installs WiringPi (built from source), Node.js 20.x, PM2 and journalctl. Safe to
re-run; it skips anything already present.

> **If it fails on the Node.js version check**, see
> [Node.js is too old](#nodejs-is-too-old-or-npm-is-missing) in troubleshooting.
> Debian trixie ships 20.19.2, which is below the script's 20.19.5 minimum, and
> its `nodejs` package does not include `npm`.

---

## 5. Build and launch

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/sabon-vendo-cashier
./setup_and_run.sh 2>&1 | tee setup_run.log
```

This builds the controller, creates the Python venv, installs npm dependencies,
registers all five processes with PM2, and persists them for auto-start on boot.

Run the test suite too — it catches a bad build before the hardware does:

```bash
cd controller && make test
```

Expect **413 passed, 0 failed**.

---

## 6. Verify

```bash
sudo pm2 list
```

Five processes, all `online`:

| PM2 name | Runs |
|----------|------|
| `01_Dispenser_Controller` | `controller/main` |
| `02_Water_Sensors` | `uploaders/water_level_monitoring.py` |
| `03_Transaction_Uploader` | `uploaders/transaction_uploader.py` |
| `04_Status_Uploader` | `uploaders/status_uploader.py` |
| `05_Cashier_Dashboard` | `cashier_dashboard/server.js` |

Then confirm both listeners are actually bound — `online` in PM2 is not proof a
process is working:

```bash
sudo ss -tlnp | grep -E ':80 |:8080 '
```

You want two lines: **:8080** owned by `main`, **:80** owned by `node`.

Check the controller came up with the right pin map and sensor polarity:

```bash
sudo pm2 logs 01_Dispenser_Controller --lines 30 --nostream | grep -E "Slot |Water sensor"
```

Open the dashboard:

```bash
hostname -I          # the Pi's LAN address
```

Browse to `http://<pi-ip>/` — **port 80, no port suffix.**

---

## 7. Calibrate the water sensors

The sensors report a raw GPIO level; which level means "empty" depends on how
they are wired. Watch the decoded state:

```bash
sudo pm2 logs 01_Dispenser_Controller --lines 0 | grep --line-buffered "Water level"
```

One line per second: `Water level: s1=ok s2=ok s3=ok s4=ok s5=ok s6=ok`
(`ok` = has liquid, `E` = empty).

Move a float by hand. **Float up should read `ok`, float down should read `E`.**

If every slot reads backwards, flip the polarity — no rebuild needed:

```bash
nano CONFIG/config.env      # set WATER_SENSOR_EMPTY_HIGH to 0 (or back to 1)
sudo pm2 restart 01_Dispenser_Controller
```

If only *some* slots are backwards, that is wiring, not software — those sensors
are wired opposite to the others. All six must be wired the same way.

> **Fail-safe note:** the default of `1` means a disconnected sensor reads HIGH,
> which reads as empty and blocks the pump. If you set it to `0`, a broken
> sensor wire looks like "has liquid" and the pump can run dry. If your floats
> close on falling, consider flipping the float physically instead.

---

## Upgrading an existing Pi

A `git pull` alone is **not enough** if you are coming from before the rename.
PM2 stores absolute script paths and the old process names.

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/sabon-vendo-cashier
git pull
sudo pm2 delete all
rm -rf coin_slot                    # stale gitignored binary the pull leaves behind
cd controller && make clean && make && make test
cd .. && ./setup_and_run.sh 2>&1 | tee setup_run.log
sudo pm2 save
```

`rm -rf coin_slot` matters: `git pull` moves the tracked files to `controller/`,
but the compiled `main` and `*.o` are gitignored, so the old directory lingers
with a stale binary in it. `config.env` needs no edit — `TRANSACTION_DIR` and
the venv path never contained `coin_slot`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### apt: "Could not get lock"

`packagekitd` holds it after boot. Wait it out with the loop in section 0, or:

```bash
sudo systemctl mask --now packagekit
# ... run your install ...
sudo systemctl unmask packagekit          # do not forget this
```

Never `rm` the lock file while an apt process is running.

### Downloads fail with "Network is unreachable"

The Pi lost its route, not a mirror problem.

```bash
ip -br a
ip route                # no "default via ..." line = no gateway
ping -c3 1.1.1.1        # works but DNS fails = DNS issue
```

If a previous install was killed mid-transaction:

```bash
sudo dpkg --configure -a
```

### Node.js is too old, or npm is missing

Debian trixie's `nodejs` is 20.19.2 (below the 20.19.5 the script wants) and
does **not** include npm. If NodeSource failed to install — usually because it
could not fetch `curl` and `gnupg` — install those first, then retry:

```bash
sudo apt install -y curl gnupg
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
node --version && npm --version
```

Confirm you got the NodeSource build, not Debian's:

```bash
apt-cache policy nodejs      # should show deb.nodesource.com
```

### Dashboard says `online` but the browser cannot reach it

Check what it is actually running:

```bash
sudo pm2 describe 05_Cashier_Dashboard | grep -E "script path"
sudo pm2 logs 05_Cashier_Dashboard --lines 30
sudo ss -tlnp | grep ':80 '
```

- **Script path is a bare `node` binary** — an old `setup_and_run.sh` bug. Fixed
  in current code; re-run the script.
- **`EADDRINUSE`** — something else holds port 80, often a preinstalled web
  server: `sudo systemctl disable --now lighttpd`
- **`EACCES`** — not running as root. Port 80 needs it; all processes must start
  via `sudo pm2`.
- **`MODULE_NOT_FOUND`** — `cd cashier_dashboard && npm install --production`
- **Works as `curl -I http://localhost/` on the Pi but not from a laptop** —
  network path, not the app.

### A button fires by itself

Its pull-up is missing. Confirm section 1 was applied and that you rebooted:

```bash
raspi-gpio get 10,13,14,23,24,25    # each must show pull=UP
```

### One water sensor never changes

```bash
raspi-gpio get 26,20,21,11,8,9      # compare the dead one against a working one
```

- **`func=ALT0`** — SPI has claimed the pin. See the SPI note in section 1.
- **`func=INPUT pull=UP` but the level never moves** — hardware. Swap that
  sensor's connector with a working slot's. If the fault follows the sensor it
  is the sensor or its wire; if it stays on the slot, move that channel to a
  free plain GPIO and update `WATER_GPIO_PIN_n` in `config.env`.

### A relay behaves opposite to the others

`PUMP_TRIGGER_HIGH`/`PUMP_TRIGGER_LOW` are **global** — every relay must use the
same polarity. Test a channel with the software stopped:

```bash
sudo pm2 stop 01_Dispenser_Controller
pinctrl set 6 op dh     # relay OFF   (use raspi-gpio set if pinctrl is absent)
pinctrl set 6 op dl    # relay ON
sudo pm2 start 01_Dispenser_Controller
```

### Nothing works after a reboot

```bash
sudo pm2 list
sudo systemctl status pm2-root
```

If PM2 is empty, the process list was never saved:

```bash
sudo pm2 startup systemd
sudo pm2 save
```

### Useful commands

```bash
sudo pm2 logs                             # all processes
sudo pm2 logs 01_Dispenser_Controller     # one process
sudo pm2 monit                            # live CPU/memory
sudo pm2 restart 01_Dispenser_Controller
nc -zv <pi-ip> 8080                       # is the controller reachable
```
